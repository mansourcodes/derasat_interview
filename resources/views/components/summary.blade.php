                        <p>The 6th Annual Derasat Forum will address the underrepresentation of women in think tanks,
                            which persists despite high levels of female enrollment in higher education programs. The
                            forum will examine the causes of this imbalance and explore methods of achieving more
                            equitable outcomes for the sector. It will also look at the impacts of female empowerment by
                            the Supreme Council for Women in Bahrain and the significance of female researchers'
                            contributions to the sector. The forum aims to provide generic analysis on the issue of
                            female empowerment, while also focusing on the specific challenges faced by think tanks and
                            thought leadership. The topic is important as the world is facing numerous major crises and
                            the contribution of think tanks to policy is at an all-time high.</p>
